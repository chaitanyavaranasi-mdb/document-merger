Document Merging DemoThis project provides a simple Python script to demonstrate a "document merging" or "resolver" pattern. This pattern is useful when you need to break a large document into smaller, manageable chunks but present them to a consumer as a single, unified object.It uses a primary document that contains pointers (in this case, documentId strings) to child documents. The resolver script fetches the primary document and then iteratively fetches and appends the content from the child documents.How It WorksPrimary Document: The process starts with a primary document (parent_document.json). This document contains metadata and a summary, along with an array childDocumentChunks that lists the unique IDs of its child documents.Child Documents: Each child document (child_document_1.json, etc.) is a separate file containing a piece of the total content.Resolver Script: The document_resolver.py script acts as the resolver. It:Takes the ID of the primary document as its starting point.Simulates a database query by searching all local .json files to find the document with the matching documentId.Reads the primary document's childDocumentChunks array.For each child ID in the array, it performs another search to find and load the corresponding child document.Finally, it constructs a new, merged JSON object that combines the content from the parent and all its children.File StructureTo run this demo, your files should be in the same directory, structured like this:/document-merging-demo
|-- document_resolver.py
|-- parent_document.json
|-- child_document_1.json
|-- child_document_2.json
UsageEnsure you have Python installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the resolver script:python merger.py
The script will print the steps of the merging process to the console, followed by the final, completely merged JSON object.Example OutputRunning the script will produce the following output, demonstrating the successful merge:{
  "documentId": "document289472_primary",
  "title": "Project Phoenix: Q3 Report",
  "author": "Jane Smith",
  "full_content": [
    {
      "section": "Summary",
      "text": "This document summarizes the findings for the third quarter. Detailed sections on methodology and key results are appended below."
    },
    {
      "section": "Detailed Methodology",
      "text": "Our methodology involved a multi-stage analysis, beginning with data collection from our primary sources. We then applied a standard deviation model to identify outliers..."
    },
    {
      "section": "Key Results & Findings",
      "text": "The key finding was a 15% increase in user engagement quarter-over-quarter. This can be directly attributed to the new UI rollout in early July..."
    }
  ]
